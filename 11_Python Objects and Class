Defining a Class in Python
Like function definitions begin with the keyword def, in Python, we define a class using the keyword class.

The first string is called docstring and has a brief description about the class. Although not mandatory, this is recommended.

Here is a simple class definition.

class MyNewClass:
    '''This is a docstring. I have created a new class'''
    pass
    
 As soon as we define a class, a new class object is created with the same name. 
 This class object allows us to access the different attributes as well as to instantiate new objects of that class.
 
class MyClass:
	"This is my second class"
	a = 10
	def func(self):
		print('Hello')

# Output: 10
print(MyClass.a)

# Output: <function MyClass.func at 0x0000000003079BF8>
print(MyClass.func)

# Output: 'This is my second class'
print(MyClass.__doc__)

Creating an Object in Python
We saw that the class object could be used to access different attributes.
It can also be used to create new object instances (instantiation) of that class. 
The procedure to create an object is similar to a function call.

>>> ob = MyClass()
This will create a new instance object named ob. We can access attributes of objects using the object name prefix.

Attributes may be data or method. Method of an object are corresponding functions of that class. Any function object that is a class attribute defines a method for objects of that class.

This means to say, since MyClass.func is a function object (attribute of class), ob.func will be a method object.

class MyClass:
	"This is my second class"
	a = 10
	def func(self):
		print('Hello')

# create a new MyClass
ob = MyClass()

# Output: <function MyClass.func at 0x000000000335B0D0>
print(MyClass.func)

# Output: <bound method MyClass.func of <__main__.MyClass object at 0x000000000332DEF0>>
print(ob.func)

# Calling function func()
# Output: Hello
 
 
 You may have noticed the self parameter in function definition inside the class but,
 we called the method simply as ob.func() without any arguments. It still worked.

This is because, whenever an object calls its method, the object itself is passed as the first argument. 
So, ob.func() translates into MyClass.func(ob).


Constructors in Python

Class functions that begins with double underscore (__) are called special functions as they have special meaning.

Of one particular interest is the __init__() function. This special function gets called whenever a new object of that class is instantiated.

This type of function is also called constructors in Object Oriented Programming (OOP). We normally use it to initialize all the variables.

class ComplexNumber:
    def __init__(self,r = 0,i = 0):
        self.real = r
        self.imag = i

    def getData(self):
        print("{0}+{1}j".format(self.real,self.imag))

# Create a new ComplexNumber object
c1 = ComplexNumber(2,3)

# Call getData() function
# Output: 2+3j
c1.getData()

# Create another ComplexNumber object
# and create a new attribute 'attr'
c2 = ComplexNumber(5)
c2.attr = 10

# Output: (5, 0, 10)
print((c2.real, c2.imag, c2.attr))

# but c1 object doesn't have attribute 'attr'
# AttributeError: 'ComplexNumber' object has no attribute 'attr'
c1.attr

In the above example, we define a new class to represent complex numbers. It has two functions, __init__() to initialize the variables (defaults to zero) and getData() to display the number properly.

An interesting thing to note in the above step is that attributes of an object can be created on the fly. We created a new attribute attr for object c2 and we read it as well. But this did not create that attribute for object c1.
